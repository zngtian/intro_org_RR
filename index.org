I use this website to maintain the presentation slides for the
workshop on Emacs, org-mode, and reproducible research.

- The slides are generated by reveal.js and beamer, respectively:
  [[file:slides.html][reveal slides]] and [[file:slides.pdf][beamer slides]].
- The materials for this workshop are maintained at
  https://github.com/zngtian/intro_org_RR.

I welcome your comments and, if possible, your contribution.
