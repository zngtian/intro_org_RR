** What are the goals of organizing this workshop?

The primary goal of giving this workshop is to share with people my
experience of using Emacs and org-mode to carry out reproducible
research.

Taking this opportunity, I want to summarize and formalize my workflow
of undertaking a research project using Emacs, org-mode, and other
software, such as R, git, Mendeley, etc.

** What to be covered?

*** About Emacs

- What is Emacs?
- What are the main feature of Emacs?
- what is the basic usage of Emacs?
- What are the major and minor modes that I will use in my research?

*** About org mode

- What is org-mode?
- What are the main feature of org-mode?
- What can we do using org-mode?

*** About reproducible research

- What is reproducible research?
- What are the must-dos in practicing reproducible research?

** How will the workshop be designed?

** What will the materials to be disseminated?
